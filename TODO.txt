(no particular order)

 o         = TODO

 x         = DONE
   nnn mmm = Release introduced into (Module for Drupal 6 / 7)
=====================

User interface
 x 622 --- display result of import
 x 622 --- display imported terms
 x 622 --- notice warnings and errors of import file
 x 622 --- choose level of message
 o         cumulate important messages with use Drupal's log
 x 622 --- auto create vocabulary
 x 630 --- test on an existing vocabulary (duplicating it)
 x 630 --- dynamic options and examples (existing items matching source content)
 x 630 --- import by a text area. See taxonomy_batch_operations
 o         text area to modify line when warning
 x 620 --- add link to use module after installation
 x 630 --- remind previous options values
 x 630 --- do a uninstall hook if remind previous options values is done
 x 622 --- warn remove when there is only one column and update is chosen
 -         reset button (useless)
 x 630 --- recommended default values button
 o         inform about changes during import (ex: relations set then unset)
 o         two steps import (validate and display warnings then process)
 o         option to choose one or two steps
 o         five step wizard for non-ahah users
 x 630 --- notice exceed file size
 o         option to import in original vocabulary after import in a duplicate
 o         no warning on last empty lines
 o         ahah ui for specific parameters
 o         disable utf8 option if textarea import
 x 640 --- add a csv enclosure option (so >= php 4.3)
 o         use Drupal themes
 o         add a menu link to taxonomy csv in list terms
 o         use drupal_set_message 'warning' and not only 'status' and 'error'.

Functions
 o         import of structured alphabetic terms list (thesaurus)
 o         import of iso 2788 as in taxonomy_xml (but KISS by line approach)
 x 623 --- option to import sub-relations and not only relations to first term
 x 623 --- option to make relations to terms of all vocabularies.
 x 630 --- import of ancestors structure and not children (change name)
 o         import of first level parents
 o         import of first level children
 x 622 --- use of parents of previous line for children without ancestors
             ("one term by line structure import")
 o         parent merge (polyhierarchy)
 x 620 --- distinction between description and synonyms
 o         multiple files import
 -         sensitive or not to uppercase/lowercase (not in D6 neither D7)
 o         integrate or reference to Taxonomy manager module
 o         remove csv terms import choice
 o         test before import (autocreate a vocabulary) (see UI)
 o         remove ignore existing terms choice (see dynamic options above)
 -         import relateds in other vocabulary before current one (not in D6)
 o         autodetect good source content and vocabulary with a command line key
 o         with autodetect, import multiple type with one file
 o         convert and export vocabulary to xml (especially to compare with xml)
 x 640 --- multistep import: autodivide big taxonomies to avoid memory error
 o         import by term identifiant (tid)
 o         import from url (#######)

Code / security
 o         remove query and use only Drupal core ones and php filters (useful?)
 x --- 740 see if there are Drupal functions to import only synonyms etc.
 x 622 --- manage and inform on input error
 o         factorize code and use more php functions (import type callback...)
 x 622 --- redo a cache
 X 622 --- clean the input line at the beginning of process and never after
 o         use taxonomy_parser?
 x 622 --- change the type of vocabulary (flat, monohierarchy, polyhierarchy)
 x 630 --- add hook_perm
 o         add hook_info
 x 630 --- replace _taxonomy_csv_parse_size by a Drupal function
 o         no order to import files
 o         use Drupal management of errors (mysql log)
 x 622 --- change function name to internal, except some
 o         vocabulary check (after and before)
 o         vocabulary relations integrety check and attribute
 -         time out control (useless with batchset mechanism)
 o         fix: keep multiple parents when children import
 x 622 --- fix: if ignore existing items, search in imported terms cache before
 o         fix: result statistic import (sometime new terms number is wrong)
 o         remove useless define
 o         use a global messages variable or sandbox to avoid multiple copy
 -         relations with other vocabularies (unsupported in Drupal 6 neither 7)
 o         extract all helps of forms to help.html in order to remove duplicates
 x 640 --- simplify batch set (all $options aren't needed)
 o         use $form_state['storage'] for batch operations?
 o         remove base64 temporary and work only with utf8
 -         use a smarter regexp delimiter than fgetcsv or explode
 o         fix: when a file is set, avoid UI bug when first option changes
 o 630 --- change Warning empty line by a simple notice
 o         modularize code to simplify addition of new schemes
 o         create API
 o         fix: make multistep import compatible with one term by line import
 o         allow cancel multistep when import in an existing vocabulary

Documentation
 o         make it simpler
 o         more examples
 o         merge advanced help and dynamic examples
 x 620 --- image view and presentation text for project page
 x 620 --- translations

Drupal version
 o --- 740 Drupal 7: All. Use terms as objects: simpler with parents, etc.
